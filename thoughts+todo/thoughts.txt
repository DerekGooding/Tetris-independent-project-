Different aspects of the game and things to consider


What are the most fundamental aspects of the game?

position
movement
block type
block connection
score
boundaries

Looking at the code for tetris, they seem to have checks for 
    
  - is given cell empty 
  - is row full
  - if row empty
  - write method that clears a row
  - write method that moves down by a certian number of rows
    
    




    a. pieces
        - how will we make them?
        - different shapes
        - randomness and new pieces
        - where pieces will spawn

    b. grid
        - grid size
        - need to print pieces over grid

    c. movement of pieces
        - speed increase
        - reaching the bottom and clear lines
            -checks if row is full
        - piece rotation and inputs to change it
        - pieces locking past a certian point

    d. score and time
        - do I even care about putting a timer in?
        - keep score simple, maybe just one point per line and 5 for a tetris
    
    
    2. How do I want to go about creating these things, and which parts should connect
    with eachother in what order?


    a. pieces
        - should probably be their own class, maybe make each into a seperate array and 
        can instatiate the object within the grid array. How would I connect them? 
        Is this overcomplicating things
        - then maybe make a list of the arrays and use a foreach to call individual pieces
        or find some other way to interate pieces through the grid
        - pieces could be objects designed for the grid 
        like {1, 1,} {1, 1,} for square, etc, using a similar method as the grid. 

        - randomness will be easy, can just do Random random = new Random(); and then assign
        the current piece using Random.Next ()

        -pieces can just spawn on the grid, its probably not worth the trouble figuring 
        out how to make them spawn off screen. Could make the grid a little bigger.

    b. grid
        - so grid can be based off the code we found online for a typical tetris grid
        which is 

        public static int width = 10;
        public static int height = 20;
        public static char[,] grid = new char[height, width];

    c. movement of pieces 
        - speed increase should be easy. we make a check using the score, or even by number
        of tetrominos like 

        if (tetrominos amount or score >= 10)
        {
            speed++
        }
